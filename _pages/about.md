I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am advised by [Dr. Vivek Sarkar](https://vsarkar.cc.gatech.edu). My research focuses on compiler optimizations, hardware-software co-design, and parallel computing. 

Before joining Georgia Tech, I worked on optimizing compilers for fully homomorphic encryption during my time at Purdue University, collaborating with [Dr. Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/).
